## Gloin (under development)

Gloin's only purpose is to automate your background wallpaper update. It fethces Bing's
Wallpaper of the day and changes your wallpaper. Now comes the best part, you can schedule
this mundane task with Gloin, just specify the time of the day and it will fetch the day's 
wallpaper and update your background.  

PS: This project is still under development. Any feature requests are welcomed through github
issues and to contribute just raise a PR.

##### Linux OS (support for `gsettings`)
Download the binary. It's a command line tool, with plans to further expand with GUI.
Gloin depends upon your settings. Those settings are initialised by `gloin configure`
This will save couple of information about when to perform the task, directory to store 
downloaded wallpapers.
